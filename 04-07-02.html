            To make your web page text easier to read, you need some sort of <dfn>paragraph indicator</dfn>, which is a visual signal to the reader that a new paragraph — a thus a new train of thought — is about to begin.
            </p>
            <p>
            The most common paragraph indicators are first-line indents and extra space between the paragraphs. On your web pages, you can use either of these methods, but not both at the same time.
            </p>
            <p>
            If you use first-line indents, the standard size is 1em, but some designers use a space that's the same width as the paragraph's line height. Note, however, that since paragraph indicators are a visual cue that signals the continuation of the text, you should not use an indicator for the first paragraph of a page or section (since the text is beginning, not continuing).
