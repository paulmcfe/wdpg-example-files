                “HTML elements enable Web-page designers to mark up a document's structure, but beyond trust and hope. you don't have any control over your text’s appearance. CSS changes that. CSS puts the designer in the driver's seat.”<br>–Håkon Wium Lie, the “father” of CSS

                Everyone knows that HTML began at CERN in the early 1990s thanks to the work of Tim Berners-Lee. What’s less well known is that CSS got its start there, too, just a few years later.
