            <span>The first use of italics came in 1500</span> when Aldus Manutius of the Aldine Press wanted a typeface that resembled the handwritten humanist script that was then in common use. He asked his typecutter Francesco Griffo to make the typeface, which Manutius first used in the frontispiece of a book of the letters of Catherine of Siena. He produced the first book set entirely in italics the next year.
