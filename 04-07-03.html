            <h1>On Typographic Transparency</h1>
            <div>
            In web typography, the <dfn>readability</dfn> of your web page text is an informal measure of how easy it is for someone to read the page's words, sentences, paragraphs, and other text blocks. A related idea is <dfn>legibility</dfn>, which is an informal measure of how easy it is for the reader to distinguish individual characters in the typeface. Together, readability and legibility form the twin supports upon which the clarity of your typographic design rests.
            </div>
            <div style="font-indent: 1em;">
            One way to look at both readability and legibility is to consider the <dfn>transparency</dfn> of your typography. If a person can read the page text without noticing the typeface or any other aspect of the typography, then your typography is said to be <i>transparent</i> to the reader. On the other hand, if the font makes it hard for the user to read the text or to make out specific characters, then your typography is getting in the way of the reader's experience.
