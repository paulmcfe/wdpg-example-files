        <h1>From the Observer, February 20, 1894</h1>
            <p>
            Jacob Speer, a German prospector, sought to end his career early on the morning of Thursday, January 25, 1894, by shooting himself with a revolver. Jacob is 63 years of age, and for the last quarter of a century, he has prospected the country between the Mary River and the Don. For years he has lived the life of a hermit and he would today probably be delving quietly away but for the fact that his lair was discovered a year or two back. The rush that ensued settled the township of Mt Jacob. He placed the revolver to his forehead and fired. The explosion knocked him down. To use his own words to the constable, “By crikey, it was a stunner!” The constable brought the old man to Gladstone. It was found that, although the muzzle was placed against the forehead, and fired straight, the bullet failed to penetrate the bone.
