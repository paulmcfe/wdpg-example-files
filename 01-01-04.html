        Let's look at these in a bit more detail:
            Combining
            This process marries a word either with one or more affixes (a prefix, infix, or suffix) or with another word. Bolting on a prefix or suffix (or both) to an existing word is probably the easiest and most common method for making new words. English has dozens of affixes—-anti-, pre-, un-, -able, -ing, -ness, and so on—-and most of us know how to wield these to give an existing word a makeover. Getting two existing words to shack up together to create a compound is also a prolific source of new terms. For example, handshake, is a compound of the words hand and shake. Finally there's the process called blending, which usually combines the first part of one word with the last part of another word. For example, brunch is a blend of breakfast and lunch.
