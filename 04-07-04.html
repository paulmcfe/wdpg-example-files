            Good typographical style dictates that you never use a first-line indent or other paragraph indicator for the first paragraph of a page or section. However, that doesn't mean the opening paragraph can't have any flair. A common flourish is a decorative first letter, which applies a special style — particularly a larger text size — to the opening letter of the paragraph.
