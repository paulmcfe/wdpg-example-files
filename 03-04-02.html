            Elements such as <code>div</code> and <code>p</code> are known as "block-level elements" because they each create a box-like container that begins on a new line and within which the content (such as text) flows. Elements such as <code>span</code> are known as "inline elements" because each one creates a container that exists within some larger element and flows along with the rest of the content in that larger element.
