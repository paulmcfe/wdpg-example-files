            <h3>Walking the Dog, by Howard Nemerov</h3>
            <p>
            Two universes mosey down the street<br>
            Connected by love and a leash and nothing else.<br>
            Mostly I look at lamplight through the leaves<br>
            While he mooches along with tail up and snout down,<br>
            Getting a secret knowledge through the nose<br>
            Almost entirely hidden from my sight.
            </p><p>
            We stand while he's enraptured by a bush<br>
            Till I can't stand our standing any more<br>
            And haul him off; for our relationship<br>
            Is patience balancing to this side tug<br>
            And that side drag; a pair of symbionts<br>
            Contented not to think each other's thoughts.
            </p>
