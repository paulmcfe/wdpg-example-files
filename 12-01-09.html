                    The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!<br>
                    Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun<br>
                    The frumious Bandersnatch!”
                 </div>
                <div>
                    He took his vorpal sword in hand:<br>
                    Long time the manxome foe he sought—<br>
                    So rested he by the Tumtum tree,<br>
                    And stood awhile in thought.
                 </div>
                <div>
                    And, as in uffish thought he stood,<br>
                    The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,<br>
                    Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,<br>
                    And burbled as it came!
                 </div>
                <div>
                    One, two! One, two! And through and through<br>
                    The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!<br>
                    He left it dead, and with its head<br>
                    He went galumphing back.
                </div>
                <div>
                    “And, has thou slain the Jabberwock?<br>
                    Come to my arms, my beamish boy!<br>
                    O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!”<br>
                    He chortled in his joy.
