            The American novelist, short-story writer, and essayist David Foster Wallace was born on February 21, 1962 in Ithaca, New York. His father was a philosophy professor and his mother was an English teacher. After growing up in Illinois (where he became a nationally-ranked junior tennis player), Wallace attended Amherst College in Massachusetts. He majored in both philosophy and English, and wrote the novel <i>The Broom of the System</i> as his senior English thesis. The book was published in 1987 while Wallace was pursuing a masterâ€™s degree in creative writing at Arizona University. The short-story collection <i>Girl With Curious Hair</i> appeared in 1989.
