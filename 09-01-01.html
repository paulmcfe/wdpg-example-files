            On March 19, 1988, a man named Robert Muller Jr. was a passenger in a car driving along US Route 441 in Florida. At some point in the journey, the car was cut off (or, at least, it appeared that way), enraging the car's occupants. Unfortunately, Mr. Muller had access to a gun, which he subsequently used to shoot out the back window of the other car, wounding 20-year-old Cassandra Stewart in the neck. Police described the shooting as an incident of "road rage," and a name for an all-too-common form of motorist madness was born.
