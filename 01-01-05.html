        What is HTML?
            The hardest thing about HTML is, by far, its name. It stands for Hypertext Markup Language, which sounds about as inviting as a tax audit. Fortunately, you can ignore the name because HTML really just means inserting a few codes strategically between stretches of regular text in such a way that you end up with an honest-to-goodness web page.
