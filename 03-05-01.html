        <h2>Word Origins: Introduction</h2>
            <div>
            In a cynical world where attention spans are 140-characters long and where much of the populace is obsessed with the low-brow goings-on of Kim or Miley or Kylie, one amazing fact rises above the muck: it's rare to meet someone who isn't in some way interested in words and language. From slang-slinging youngsters to crossword-solving oldsters, from inveterate punsters to intrepid neologists, some aspect of language appeals to everyone.

            Is there one slice of the language pie that everyone likes? Probably not. People are just too complex to like any one thing universally. However, in my own admittedly limited experience (I haven't met every person in the world), I have yet to come across a person who doesn't appreciate a good story about the origins of a word or phrase.
