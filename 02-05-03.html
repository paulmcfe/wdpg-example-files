            In his book Daily Rituals, Mason Currey relates the day-to-day routines of many famous artists, scientists, and writers. Those who included a daily walk with their dog (or sometimes dogs) include composers Gustav Mahler and John Adams, writers Henry James, P. G. Wodehouse, and Nicholson Baker, and artists Pablo Picasso and Georgia Oâ€™Keefe.
