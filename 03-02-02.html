        <h2>Break, Break, Break</h2>
            <p>
            Break, break, break,
            On thy cold gray stones, O sea!
            And I would that my tongue could utter
            The thoughts that arise in me.
            </p><p>
            O, well for the fishermanâ€™s boy,
            That he shouts with his sister at play!
            O, well for the sailor lad,
            That he sings in his boat on the bay!
            </p><p>
            And the stately ships go on
            To their haven under the hill;
            But O for the touch of a vanished hand,
            And the sound of a voice that is still!
            </p><p>
            Break, break, break,
            At the foot of thy crags, O sea!
            But the tender grace of a day that is dead
            Will never come back to me.
            </p>
            &mdash;Alfred Lord Tennyson
