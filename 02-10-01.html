            Where do new words come from? Sometimes we&rsquo;re lucky enough to know the answer. For example, the word <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=scofflaw">scofflaw</a> originated as a contest winner and <a href="https://wordspy.com/index.php?word=frankenfood">Frankenfood</a> came from a letter to the editor of a newspaper.
