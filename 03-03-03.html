        <h2>Dividing Web Page Text</h2>
            <p>
            In Chapter 8, “Laying Our Your Page,” you learn about the HTML5 sectioning tags, including <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>. These enable you to structure your page semantically by designating containers not only as sections and articles within those sections, but also as headers, footers, navigation, and more. However, not all text falls neatly into any of the HTML5 semantic categories. For text that requires a container but for which none of the semantic elements (including the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag) are appropriate, HTML offers the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag.
            <p>
            However, although the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag is one of the most common elements, the W3C is now discouraging its use:
            </p>
            Authors are strongly encouraged to view the div element as an element of last resort, for when no other element is suitable. Use of more appropriate elements instead of the div element leads to better accessibility for readers and easier maintainability for authors.
