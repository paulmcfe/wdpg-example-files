            The American novelist, short-story writer, and essayist David Foster Wallace was born on February 21, 1962 in Ithaca, New York. His father was a philosophy professor and his mother was an English teacher. After growing up in Illinois (where he became a nationally-ranked junior tennis player), Wallace attended Amherst College in Massachusetts. He majored in both philosophy and English, and wrote the novel <i>The Broom of the System</i> as his senior English thesis. The book was published in 1987 while Wallace was pursuing a master’s degree in creative writing at Arizona University. The short-story collection <i>Girl With Curious Hair</i> appeared in 1989.

            After receiving his M.F.A. from Arizona, Wallace moved to Syracuse, New York, and began working on a massive novel, which was eventually published as Infinite Jest in 1996. The book was a literary fiction bestseller and received much critical acclaim, with The <i>New York Times</i> calling it “a masterpiece” and Time magazine adding the book to its list of the top 100 English-language novels published since 1923.

            Wallace also wrote a number of short stories, as well as essays and journalistic pieces for publications such as <i>Harper’s</i>, <i>Esquire</i>, <i>The Atlantic</i>, and even <i>Gourmet</i> magazine.

            David Foster Wallace suffered from severe depression all his adult life and he struggled with drug addiction and alcoholism. An antidepressant medication enabled him to live a mostly normal and productive life, but he took himself off the medication in 2007 because he felt it was interfering with his writing. His depression returned and he was unable to find an effective treatment. He committed suicide on September 12, 2008.
