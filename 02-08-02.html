        <p>According to the W3C specification, the <code>q</code> element  represents some phrasing content quoted from another source. However, the specification also includes the following warning: The <code>q</code> element must not be used in place of quotation marks that do not represent quotes; for example, it is inappropriate to use the <code>q</code> element for marking up sarcastic statements.</p>
