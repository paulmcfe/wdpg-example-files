                <h1>Auguries of Innocence</h1>
                <h2>by William Blake</h2>
                <div class="poem">
                To see a World in a Grain of Sand <br>
                And a Heaven in a Wild Flower <br>
                Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand <br>
                And Eternity in an hour<br>
                A Robin Red breast in a Cage <br>
                Puts all Heaven in a Rage <br>
                A Dove house filld with Doves & Pigeons <br>
                Shudders Hell thr' all its regions <br>
                A dog starvd at his Masters Gate <br>
                Predicts the ruin of the State <br>
                A Horse misusd upon the Road <br>
                Calls to Heaven for Human blood <br>
                Each outcry of the hunted Hare <br>
                A fibre from the Brain does tear <br>
                A Skylark wounded in the wing <br>
                A Cherubim does cease to sing <br>
                The Game Cock clipd & armd for fight <br>
                Does the Rising Sun affright <br>
                Every Wolfs & Lions howl <br>
                Raises from Hell a Human Soul <br>
                The wild deer, wandring here & there <br>
                Keeps the Human Soul from Care <br>
                The Lamb misusd breeds Public Strife <br>
                And yet forgives the Butchers knife <br>
                The Bat that flits at close of Eve <br>
                Has left the Brain that wont Believe<br>
                The Owl that calls upon the Night <br>
                Speaks the Unbelievers fright<br>
                He who shall hurt the little Wren <br>
                Shall never be belovd by Men <br>
                He who the Ox to wrath has movd <br>
                Shall never be by Woman lovd<br>
                The wanton Boy that kills the Fly <br>
                Shall feel the Spiders enmity <br>
                He who torments the Chafers Sprite <br>
                Weaves a Bower in endless Night <br>
                The Catterpiller on the Leaf <br>
                Repeats to thee thy Mothers grief <br>
                Kill not the Moth nor Butterfly <br>
                For the Last Judgment draweth nigh <br>
                He who shall train the Horse to War <br>
                Shall never pass the Polar Bar <br>
                The Beggars Dog & Widows Cat <br>
                Feed them & thou wilt grow fat <br>
                The Gnat that sings his Summers Song <br>
                Poison gets from Slanders tongue <br>
                The poison of the Snake & Newt <br>
                Is the sweat of Envys Foot <br>
                The poison of the Honey Bee <br>
                Is the Artists Jealousy<br>
                The Princes Robes & Beggars Rags <br>
                Are Toadstools on the Misers Bags <br>
                A Truth thats told with bad intent <br>
                Beats all the Lies you can invent <br>
                It is right it should be so <br>
                Man was made for Joy & Woe <br>
                And when this we rightly know <br>
                Thro the World we safely go <br>
                Joy & Woe are woven fine <br>
                A Clothing for the soul divine <br>
                Under every grief & pine <br>
                Runs a joy with silken twine <br>
                The Babe is more than swadling Bands<br>
                Throughout all these Human Lands <br>
                Tools were made & Born were hands <br>
                Every Farmer Understands<br>
                Every Tear from Every Eye <br>
                Becomes a Babe in Eternity <br>
                This is caught by Females bright <br>
                And returnd to its own delight <br>
                The Bleat the Bark Bellow & Roar <br>
                Are Waves that Beat on Heavens Shore <br>
                The Babe that weeps the Rod beneath <br>
                Writes Revenge in realms of Death <br>
                The Beggars Rags fluttering in Air<br>
                Does to Rags the Heavens tear <br>
                The Soldier armd with Sword & Gun <br>
                Palsied strikes the Summers Sun<br>
                The poor Mans Farthing is worth more <br>
                Than all the Gold on Africs Shore<br>
                One Mite wrung from the Labrers hands <br>
                Shall buy & sell the Misers Lands <br>
                Or if protected from on high <br>
                Does that whole Nation sell & buy <br>
                He who mocks the Infants Faith <br>
                Shall be mockd in Age & Death <br>
                He who shall teach the Child to Doubt <br>
                The rotting Grave shall neer get out <br>
                He who respects the Infants faith <br>
                Triumphs over Hell & Death <br>
                The Childs Toys & the Old Mans Reasons <br>
                Are the Fruits of the Two seasons <br>
                The Questioner who sits so sly <br>
                Shall never know how to Reply <br>
                He who replies to words of Doubt <br>
                Doth put the Light of Knowledge out <br>
                The Strongest Poison ever known <br>
                Came from Caesars Laurel Crown <br>
                Nought can Deform the Human Race <br>
                Like to the Armours iron brace <br>
                When Gold & Gems adorn the Plow <br>
                To peaceful Arts shall Envy Bow <br>
                A Riddle or the Crickets Cry <br>
                Is to Doubt a fit Reply <br>
                The Emmets Inch & Eagles Mile <br>
                Make Lame Philosophy to smile <br>
                He who Doubts from what he sees <br>
                Will neer Believe do what you Please <br>
                If the Sun & Moon should Doubt <br>
                Theyd immediately Go out <br>
                To be in a Passion you Good may Do <br>
                But no Good if a Passion is in you <br>
                The Whore & Gambler by the State <br>
                Licencd build that Nations Fate <br>
                The Harlots cry from Street to Street <br>
                Shall weave Old Englands winding Sheet <br>
                The Winners Shout the Losers Curse <br>
                Dance before dead Englands Hearse <br>
                Every Night & every Morn <br>
                Some to Misery are Born <br>
                Every Morn and every Night <br>
                Some are Born to sweet delight <br>
                Some are Born to sweet delight <br>
                Some are Born to Endless Night <br>
                We are led to Believe a Lie <br>
                When we see not Thro the Eye <br>
                Which was Born in a Night to perish in a Night <br>
                When the Soul Slept in Beams of Light <br>
                God Appears & God is Light <br>
                To those poor Souls who dwell in Night <br>
                But does a Human Form Display <br>
                To those who Dwell in Realms of day
