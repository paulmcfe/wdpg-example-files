                Getting a Web Host
            </h1>
            <p>
            	When you're looking for a web host, you have three main choices:
            </p>
            <ul>   
                <li>Your Internet service provider</li>
                <li>A free web hosting provider</li>
                <li>A commercial web hosting provider</li>
            </ul>
            <div>
            	<h2>
                	Your Internet service provider (ISP)
                </h2>
                The company or institution you use to access the internet may also offer a web hosting service. Many ISPs offer free web hosting for simple personal websites, and some organization networks include a web server that you can use. In most cases, the hosting includes features such as bandwidth and disk space at the lower end of the scale.
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>
                    A free web hosting provider
                </h2>
                Many services will host your web pages without charge. The catch is that you usually have fairly severe restrictions on most hosting features, particularly bandwidth and disk space, and you almost always get only a single website. Some free web hosts also display ads, although that's becoming rare these days.    
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>
                    A commercial web hosting provide
                </h2>
            	If you want to get a reasonable set of features for your web presence, you need to shell out money to rent space with a commercial web hosting provider. Note that I'm not talking about big bucks. Popular providers such as Bluehost (https://www.bluehost.com), GoDaddy (https://www.godaddy.com), and HostGator (http://www.hostgator.com) offer feature-packed hosting usually for less than $5 dollars per month. If you think you'll be getting into web design beyond the creation of a basic home page, you should definitely consider a commercial web host.
